# Note-Taker
So this project consisted of building the backend code to essentially help any user create notes, with the option of saving and deleting them. 

This project as a whole was completley fullfilling and challenging. I really enjoyed doing this one because I was able to teach myself over and over 
how to sucessfully deploy the code, have the port listen, have the server speak to the client and also the deployment through heroku.
